.SH DESCRIPTION
AMPRnet is a RIPv4 Listener and route injector daemon used with AMPRnet gateways.
.IP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-?, \fB\-h\fR
Usage info
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Debug mode: no daemonization, verbose output
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
More verbose debug output
Using this option without debug leaves the console attached
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Save routes to \fI\,/var/lib/ampr\-ripd/encap.txt\/\fP (encap format),
if this file exists, it will be loaded on startup regardless
of this option
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Compatibility only (ignored, raw sockets are always used)
.TP
\fB\-i\fR <interface>
Tunnel interface to use, defaults to tunl0
.TP
\fB\-t\fR <table>
Routing table to use, defaults to 'main'
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
<ip>[,<ip>...]    Comma separated list of IPs, hostnames or ampr subnets to be ignored.
Subnets can be in full network/mask (e.g. 44.182.20.0/24) or encap (e.g. 44.182.20/24) format,
but MUST match an entry in the RIP broadcast
If a hostname is used, its IP will be re\-resolved 30 sec after every RIP broadcast.
The List contains local interface IPs by default
.TP
\fB\-m\fR <metric>
Metric to be used when setting routes.
This is a numerical value from 0 to 255. Defaults to 0.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR <window>
Sets the TCP window size to a given value (defaults to 840).
This is needed since IP over AX.25 connections have small TCP window size.
A value of 0 disables setting the window size (not recommended, default value should be ok)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR <interface>
Interface for RIP forwarding, defaults to none/disabled
.TP
\fB\-e\fR <ip>
Forward destination IP, defaults to 224.0.0.9 if enabled
.TP
\fB\-x\fR <system command>
Execute this system command after route set/change. If the command includes white spaces, use quotes.
.TP
.B Observation
All routes are created with netlink protocol 44 for easy management
.IP
.SH SIGNALS
.IP
\- On signal SIG_HUP, ampr\-ripd will delete all set routes, but will remain active,
so routes will be set again on next received RIPv2 set, and the saved encap file updated.
.IP
\- On signal SIG_TERM (exit), ampr\-ripd will delete all set routes and exit.
.IP
.SH DEBUG
With the default debug level, using the \fB\-d\fR option,
the daemon will stay in the foreground. To have full debug output, it has to be compiled with
\fB\-D\fR HAVE_DEBUG or by uncommenting the right DOPT line.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
When using other table than 'main', interogating the routes via netlink does not work properly.
This means that on any update, the route is deleted and then recreated, even if it is already set correctly.
This should be no problem since this happen only at startup on encap loading and on route change.
